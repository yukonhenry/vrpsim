# Vehicle Routing Problem Simulator
Python/Simpy-based simulation platform to investigate various aspects of modeling and algorithmic solutions for Vehicle Routing Problem.  Initial formulation focuses on the following three areas:

1. Statistical modeling of arrival rates for work orders, especially with respect to time-varying demands and modeling of 'busy times'
2. Resource planning based on demand forecast.
3. Comparison of on-demand route planning with and without apriori statistical knowledge of demand.
